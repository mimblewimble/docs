    === "Receive"

        * Copy your address (`grin1...`) and provide it to the other party.
         That's it. If both your wallets can communicate via Tor, the transaction is then completed automatically.

        *But if there's no Tor communication, next steps are:*

        * The sender will provide you a Slatepack message. Paste it into the Slatepack box and click Receive.
        * Copy the Slatepack message your wallet generates and give it to the sender 
        * Done! The sender will finalize the transaction and post it to the network, it should show up in your wallet.

    === "Send"

        * Click send.
        * Choose the amount of grins.
        * Enter the receiver's address and send.

        That's it. If both your wallets can communicate via Tor, the transaction is then completed automatically.

        * But if there's no Tor communication, next steps are:*

        * Copy the Slatepack message your wallet generates and provide it to the receiver (however you want).

        * You should get a Slatepack message back from the receiver. Paste it into the Slatepack box and click Finalize.

        Done! Your wallet will now finalize the transaction and post it to the network.
