In **Jul. 2016**, Someone called **Tom Elvis Jedusor** (Voldemort's French name in [J.K. Rowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling)'s [Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter) book series) placed the original **MimbleWimble** white paper on a bitcoin research channel, and then disappeared.

Tom's white paper "Mimblewimble" (a tongue-tying curse used in "[The Deathly Hallows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows)") was a blockchain proposal that could theoretically increase privacy, scalability and fungibility. 

In **Oct. 2016**, **[Ignotus Peverell](https://github.com/ignopeverell)** (name also came from "Harry Potter", the original owner of the invisibility cloak, if you know the Harry Potter characters) started a Github project called **Grin** (Yes! This project.), and began turning the MimbleWimble paper into something real.

In **Jan. 2017**, **[Andrew Poelstra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-poelstra-958a75106)**, a mathematician at Blockstream, presented on this work at Stanford University's Blockchain Protocol Analysis and Security Engineering 2017 conference. And he wrote the [precise paper](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/wizardry/mimblewimble.pdf), made precise Tom's original idea, and added further scaling improvements on it.

And in **Mar. 2017**, **[Ignotus Peverell](https://github.com/ignopeverell)** posted a technical [introduction](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/doc/intro.md) to MimbleWimble and Grin on Github. 

That's the interesting story of MimbleWimble/Grin white paper. Here are the three parts of them:

- [MimbleWimble Origin](MimbleWimble-Origin.md)
- [Precise Version](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/wizardry/mimblewimble.pdf)
- [Introduction](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/doc/intro.md)
