# MimbleCheck

MimbleWimble as an idea was released anonymously. It's a block chain with PoW but [almost nothing else](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/No-this,-no-that).

Grin is an in-progress implementation of the MimbleWimble protocol.
Many characteristics of MimbleWimble and Grin are still undefined.
Please read our [introduction to MimbleWimble and Grin](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/doc/intro.md)

## Philosophy

* Grin wants to be a minimal implementation.

* It wants to be inclusive and welcoming for all walks of life, without judgement.

* Grin aims high, to bring improvements for all, without harming others.

* The Grin implementation's maintainers may have strong opinions
to stay lean and simple, without diminishing others.

* We believe in pull requests, data and scientific research.

* We do not take interest in unfounded beliefs.
