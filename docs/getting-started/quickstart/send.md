# Sending Grins

To send grins, use the `send` command and specify both the destination address (`-d`) and the amount.

```bash
grin-wallet send -d [address] [amount]
```

Example of sending 90 grins:

```bash
grin-wallet send -d grin1dhvv9mvarqwl6fderuxp3qgl6qppvhc9p4u24347ec0mvgg6342q4w6x56 90
```

!!! note "Locked Outputs"
    From now on and until confirmed in the chain, the outputs used in this transaction are [locked](../wallet-handbook.md#cancel).

The wallets will interact through Tor and complete the process automatically.

However, If the connection wasn't successful, your wallet will output a Slatepack message which you need to provide the receiver with. The receiver then uses the `receive` command to process it (as demonstrated earlier), and returns back a Slatepack he produced himself.

Simply type the following command:

```bash
grin-wallet finalize
```

And enter into the prompt the Slatepack message you got from the receiver.

Your wallet will complete the transaction building process and post it to the network, along with a fee, to be included in an upcoming block. Celebrate this milestone with an unapologizing smile ãƒ„
