# Grin

Grin is an in-progress implementation of the MimbleWimble protocol.
Many characteristics are still undefined.
Please read our [introduction to MimbleWimble and Grin](basics/intro.md)

## What is "docs"?

Here we document MimbleWimble
and its implementations (grin, grin in C#, gringo, etc)
and anything related.

We have:
 - [introduction material](intro/)
 - [technical documentation](tech/)
 - [community-organized wiki pages](wiki/)

## Status of implementations

We're doing early testing in Testnet1 with grin, the rust implementation.

Join us! And [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are very welcome.

## Philosophy

* Grin wants to be a minimal implementation.

* It wants to be inclusive and welcoming for all walks of life, without judgement.

* Grin aims high, to bring improvements for all, without harming others.

* The Grin implementation's maintainers may have strong opinions
to stay lean and simple, without diminishing others.

* We believe in pull requests, data and scientific research.

* We do not take interest in unfounded beliefs.
